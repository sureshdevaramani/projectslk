            The Insured’s Declared Value (IDV) of the vehicle will be deemed to be the ‘SUM INSURED’ for the purpose of this policy which is fixed at the commencement of each policy period for the insured  vehicle.

            The IDV of the vehicle (and accessories if any fitted to the vehicle) is to be fixed on the basis of the manufacturer’s listed selling price of the brand and model as the vehicle insured at the commencement of insurance/renewal and adjusted for depreciation (as per schedule below).

            The schedule of age-wise depreciation as shown below is applicable for the purpose of Total Loss/Constructive Total Loss (TL/CTL) claims only.

        <p>
            IDV of  vehicles  beyond 5 years of age and of obsolete models of the vehicles  ( i.e. models which the manufacturers have discontinued to manufacture) is to be determined on the basis of an understanding  between the  insurer and the insured.

            IDV shall be treated as the ‘Market Value’ throughout the policy period  without any further depreciation for the purpose of Total Loss (TL) / Constructive Total Loss (CTL) claims.

            The insured vehicle shall be treated as a CTL if the aggregate cost of retrieval and / or repair of the vehicle, subject to terms and conditions of the policy, exceeds 75% of the IDV of the vehicle.
